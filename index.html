    <h2>Tomatoes Do Not Belong In Burgers</h2>
    <h4> <time datetime="2024-10-07">October 7, 2024</time> by Jhanoi Samuels</h4>

    <p>
        Some argue that tomatoes don't belong on burgers due to their impact on texture and flavor balance. Tomatoes, being watery and often served cold, can make a burger feel soggy, especially if the tomato slice is too thick or overripe. 
        This added moisture can also cause the bun to become soft and fall apart, detracting from the burger's overall structure. 
        Additionally, the temperature contrast between the cold tomato and the hot patty can be unappealing for those who prefer a more consistent, warm bite throughout the burger.

        From a flavor perspective, tomatoes can clash with the savory elements of the burger. Their acidity and sweetness may overpower or alter the intended balance of the patty, cheese, and condiments.
        Some burger purists argue that simpler toppings allow the meat and cheese to be the stars of the dish, and introducing tomatoes can distract from these key flavors. 
        Ultimately, whether tomatoes belong on burgers is a matter of personal preference, with many opting to skip them for a more cohesive, savory experience.

        <h2> Cats Are The Worst Pets</h2>
        <h4> <time datetime="2024-10-07">October 7, 2024</time> by Jhanoi Samuels</h4>

    <p>
        Cats can be considered the worst pets for some people due to their independent and often aloof nature. Unlike dogs, which are known for their loyalty and affection, cats tend to be more solitary and less responsive to commands or human interaction. 
        They are often content to do as they please, which can make them seem detached or uninterested in bonding with their owners. This independence can be frustrating for those who desire constant companionship or enjoy the interactive nature of other pets, like dogs or birds. 
        Additionally, cats can be difficult to train, and many owners find themselves dealing with scratched furniture, litter box issues, or cats that refuse to listen to basic commands.

        Another reason some people find cats to be poor pets is their unpredictability and temperamental behavior. Cats can go from being calm and affectionate to aggressive or skittish with little warning, making them hard to read and sometimes untrustworthy around children or guests. 
        Their sharp claws and tendency to scratch can cause injuries, and unlike dogs, cats are often not apologetic or responsive after such incidents. Moreover, some cats can be highly territorial, leading to spraying or marking their territory in the house, which can create hygiene issues. 
        These behaviors, combined with their sometimes dismissive attitude toward human interaction, make cats frustrating for those who prefer pets that are more affectionate and reliable.
